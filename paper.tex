% Section numbering is automatic.

Physics concepts are particularly suited to be explored via kinesthetic activities.  Indeed, concepts in physics, such as kinematics and dynamics are central to our kinesthetic experience of the world.  A number of authors have begun incorporating kinesthetic activities
